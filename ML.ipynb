(the colour of the caramel should not deepen or darken in colour as this will lead to a bitter tasting halwa)give a quick stir to the flour-semolina batter and slowly add it to the caramelised sugar.now, starts the tricky part. hold the wok or pan firmly using a cloth or holder (to avoid the heat) so that you can work your way with the batter. using ladle (a large heavy spoon/ kalchhul), carefully yet swiftly start mixing the batter into the caramel. the batter will seem to turn lumpy but nothing to worry.increase the flame to medium and using the back of the spoon keep smashing the batter, especially the whitish lumps, till the whole batter gets completed assimilated and incorporated with the caramel and the halwa wears a homogeneous look.this process will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. you will also notice that the halwa releases the oil as it begins to come together as evenly toned mixture. at this point, remove excess oil in a small bowl and again roast the halwa for 3 to 4 minutes. switch off the heat and push the halwa towards the edge of one side of the wok to allow any excess ghee to drain in the centre. once the ghee leaves the halwa, drain it out in the bowl. halwa is now ready to be served!serve mukhadi halwa as a lunch after your weekday meal of dal makhani, aloo ki sabzi and phulka.\n",

            "Instructions: to begin making the creamy gulkand kulfi recipe, we will first have to condense the milk. for this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. it is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.this is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. finally stir in the fennel seed powder, almond powder saffron and gulkand into the kulfi milk mixture.turn off the heat and allow the gulkand kulfi mixture to cool completely. pour the gulkand kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator.the gulkand kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.  if you get wooden ice cream sticks in the market, you can insert them in and freeze the kulfis.once frozen you can run the gulkand kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release onto the plate and serve.serve the gulkand kulfi recipe for your holi or diwali party or when you have an elaborate indian dinner menu planned for your parties.\n",
